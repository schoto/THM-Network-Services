**Understanding NFS**

What is NFS?

NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.

How does NFS work?

We don't need to understand the technical exchange in too much detail to be able to exploit NFS effectively- 
however if this is something that interests you, I would recommend this resource: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

- The file handle
  
- The name of the file to be accessed
  
- The user's, user ID
  
- The user's group ID

These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.

 What runs NFS?

Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.

A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.

**Enumerating NFS**

Enumeration is defined as "a process which establishes an active connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system." - Infosec Institute. It is a critical phase when considering how to enumerate and exploit a remote machine - as the information you will use to inform your attacks will come from this stage

Requirements

In order to do a more advanced enumeration of the NFS server, and shares- we're going to need a few tools. The first of which is key to interacting with any NFS share from your local machine: nfs-common.

NFS-Common

It is important to have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as client or server. It includes programs such as: lockd, statd, showmount, nfsstat, gssd, idmapd and mount.nfs. Primarily, we are concerned with "showmount" and "mount.nfs" as these are going to be most useful to us when it comes to extracting information from the NFS share. If you'd like more information about this package, feel free to read: https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common.

You can install nfs-common using "sudo apt install nfs-common", it is part of the default repositories for most Linux distributions such as the Kali Remote Machine or AttackBox that is provided to TryHackMe.

Port Scanning

Port scanning has been covered many times before, so I'll only cover the basics that you need for this room here. If you'd like to learn more about nmap in more detail please have a look at the nmap room.

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, open ports and operating system of the target machine. You can go as in-depth as you like on this, however, I suggest using nmap with the -A and -p- tags.

Mounting NFS shares

Your clientâ€™s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

```sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock```

Let's break this down

Tag	||||||| Function

```sudo```	Run as root

```mount```	Execute the mount command

```-t nfs```	Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS

```IP:share```	The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount

```-nolock```	Specifies not to use NLM locking


Now we understand our tools, let's get started!

**Questions / Answers**

Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?

```nmap 10.10.234.244```

7 ports are open

Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?

```2049```

Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?

```/usr/sbin/showmount -e 10.10.215.117```

```/home```


Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use "```mkdir /tmp/mount```" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?

```mkdir /tmp/mount```

```sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.215.117:home /tmp/mount/ -nolock```

```cd /tmp/mount``` then ```ls``` and we will see ```cappucino```
